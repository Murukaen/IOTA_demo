    "# The Problem with Blockchains\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalability\n",
    "- Bitcoin's blockchain takes about 10 minutes to confirm a transaction. About [200K](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) unconfirmed transactions at a time\n",
    "- This is annoying. What if you don't wanna wait? Or pay a higher fee? Or deal with transaction uncertainty?\n",

    "\n",
    "## Fees  \n",
    "- Bitcoin’s mean transaction fees have already risen above 1 dollar. This can be more than the transaction amount itself.\n",
    "- Solutions include increasing block size limit, lightning network, central servers for off-chain transactions, sidechains, and treechains\n",

    "\n",
    "## Lots of computing power required\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mining is somewhat centralized in Bitcoin by giant mining pools\n",
    "- Transaction speed declines as the network increases in size as more transactions compete for the limited block spaces\n",
    "- It will take more and more computing power to mine the same amount of Bitcoin. \n",

    "## Vulnerable to Quantum Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bitcoin and other Proof of Work based blockchains are susceptible to being broken by a powerful quantum computer\n",
    "- On average one must check around 2^68 nonces to find a suitable hash that allows to generate a block. A quantum computer would need Θ(√ N) operations to solve a problem that needs Θ(N) operations on a classical computer. Therefore, a quantum computer would be around √ 2^68 = 2^34 ≈ 17 billion times more efficient in Bitcoin mining than a classical one\n",

    "# IOTA Architecture (2 big differences from a blockchain)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big Difference #1 (Structure) - Blockchains are so 2017. IOTA uses a BlockDAG\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blockchains are sequential chains where blocks are added in regular intervals.\n",
    "- the Tangle a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) so its able achieve high transaction throughput (by parallelizing validation) and no transaction fees on transactions. \n",
    "- As it grows and more participants make transactions, the overall system becomes more secure and faster, with confirmation times / transaction finality going down.\n",
    "- But look it’s still a distributed database, it’s still a P2P Network and it still relies on a consensus and validation mechanism.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big Difference #2 (Consensus) - No Miners! \n",
    "\n",
    "- Blockchain consensus is achieved byrequiring multiple parties to \"race\" against each other in an attempt to add the next Block to the Blockchain and get the block reward / transaction fees. \n",
    "- Because of this, consensus is decoupled from transaction generation and is largely performed by a smaller subset of the network, oftentimes with a high entry barrier (as is the case in Bitcoin) which leads to further centralization\n",
    "-  In IOTA, every participant in the network making a transaction also actively participates in the consensus. \n",
    "- You reference two transactions directly and other transactions in the sub-tangle indirectly. \n",
    "- Through this, validation is parallelized and the network stay completely decentralized, with no miners to delegate trust to or having to pay a transaction fee.\n",
    "- So there are no “blocks” in the classical sense. Instead, a single transaction references two past transactions. This referencing of transactions is seen as an attestation: with your transaction you attest directly that two transactions, and indirectly that a subsection of the Tangle are valid and conform to the protocols rules.\n",

    "- Green blocks: transactions on which consensus was achieved\n",
    "- red blocks: transactions where we are still uncertain on their full acceptance\n",

    "\n",
    "### Basically,  instead of a smaller subset of the network being responsible for the overall consensus (miners / stakers), the entire network of active participants (i.e. devices making transactions), are directly involved in the approval of transactions. As such, consensus in IOTA is no longer decoupled from the transaction making process: it’s an intrinsic part of it, and it’s what enables IOTA to scale without any transaction fees.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Oh, and it's quantum-resistant\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read about it here https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/8979/winternitz-one-time-signature\n",

    "\n",
    "## How does a transaction work in IOTA?\n",
    "\n",
    "## It's a 3 step process to make a transaction \n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Signing - You sign the transaction inputs with your private keys\n",
    "- Step 2: Tip Selection -  MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) is used to randomly select two tips (i.e. unconfirmed transactions), which will be referenced by your transaction (branchTransaction and trunkTransaction)\n",
    "- Step 3: Proof of Work -  In order to have your transaction accepted by the network, you need to do some Proof of Work — similar to Hashcash (spam and sybil-resistance)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Once you’ve done that, your transaction will be broadcast to the network. Someone else will come along, choose your transaction in the tip selection process and validate it. And just like that, your transaction is confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's quite easy to determine the confirmation level of your transaction: it executes the MCMC algorithm N times, the probability of your transaction being accepted is therefore M of N (M being the number of times you land on a tip that has a direct path to your transaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a merchant, in IOTA you have complete freedom to decide with what probability you will start accepting transactions. If you are happy with 51% probability, you execute MCMC 100 times, and if 51 times or more there is a path, you accept the transaction and exchange goods. For high value transaction you can increase this threshold to 99 or even 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does IOTA prevent double spending?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the tangle, transactions are atomic. During processing though, bundles are.\n",
    "- When a full node is asked to provide tips to a light node to create a transaction, the full node will walk backwards along the edges of the DAG to the genesis transaction and check if there are any conflicting transactions along the way. If there is then that tip is discarded. If there isn't then the tip is considered valid.\n",
    "- An attacker would have to outpace the input flow of new transactions. The tangle is network bound -- requiring an attacker to be everywhere at the same time.\n",
    "- So full nodes are constantly being asked to provide branch and trunk tips to light nodes for bundling purposes and will only select tips free of conclict. The attacker will try and do the same with his double-spend and has to find a way to overwhelm the entire network's influx.\n",
    "- There is no global consistency in the tangle. There is only eventual consistency.\n",
    "- Stuck transactions are called orphans. They can be grouped together in subtangles. I imagine they'll be dropped by the protocol at some point, but I can't recall specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To make it possible for the network to grow and protect it against certain attacks, IOTA currently relies on a coordinator. The coordinator checkpoints valid transactions, which are then validated by the entire network. The coordinator is being run by the IOTA Foundation in a multi-signature. The coordinator cannot go rogue, as he is being checked and validated by the entire network.\n",
